    "ingredients": ["100 g whole milk", "35 g water", "12 g unsalted butter", "170 g cake/pastry flour", "50 g cornstarch", "2 g baking powder", "7 g sugar", "2 g salt"],
    "instructions": "Sift the flour into a medium bowl, set aside.\nAdd the sugar together with the salt and the baking powder. Mix with the help of a spatula.\nIn a saucepan pour the milk together with the water and the butter. Place at medium heat and leave until the butter melts, but without boiling.\nRemove from the heat and pour over the dry ingredients. Integrate the ingredients with the help of a spatula.\nBegin to knead, amalgamate the dough with your hands.\nTransfer to a clean work surface and start kneading. If, as you knead, you notice that the dough is very dry, you can add a few drops of water, but without exceeding ourselves. The dough should be slightly dry to the touch, but that allows us to manipulate it without cracking.\nWe will work the dough until it is homogeneous, practically smooth and the flour has been completely integrated. It will take about 5-7 minutes.\nCover with the bowl and leave to stand for 10 minutes.\nDivide the dough and stretch.\nRemove the film from the dough. Using a metal scraper or a sharp knife, divide the piece into 15, more or less equal, portions. While we work on each piece to stretch it, cover the rest with film to prevent it from drying out. This is very important.\nTake one of the portions and stretch slightly with your fingertips.\nStretch the dough with a roller to a very thin, almost transparent thickness. We will stretch the dough very delicately to help achieve the desired diameter, this will be around 5,9-6,3 inches (15-16 cm).\nPlace a ring or plate on the dough and remove the excess with the help of a very sharp knife.\nTake the piece and place it on a sheet of kitchen paper or waxed paper (if you have). Cover with another sheet of kitchen paper and then with a cloth.\nRepeat the process with the rest of the pieces.\nDecorate.\nTo decorate the leaf bread or laufabrauð, you use a utensil called laufabrauðsjárn. In my case I don't have it, so I used a blade. You could also use a very sharp knife.\nDecorate the bread making cuts on the surface. You will appreciate this step much better in the video. We must always make pair cuts.\nOnce we have decorated one of the breads, place it again on a sheet of paper, cover it with another sheet and the cloth. Just like we did the first time.\nRepeat the process with the rest of the breads.\nFry.\nFill a medium saucepan with enough oil to be able to fry the breads and float.\nPlace at medium heat and let it reach a temperature of around 345ºF (175ºC).\nThis step will be quite fluid, we will go fast so I advise you to leave everything prepared.\nPlace several pieces of kitchen paper where we can drain the bread that we are taking out and a space to be able to go stacking the breads.\nPrick the surface of the bread and put a bread in the pot and fry during few seconds by each side. As it is very fine, it will be cooked immediately, the ideal is that we are left with a light golden color.\nRemove from the pot, drain and place on the kitchen paper.\nQuickly and with the help of kitchen paper, press the surface to flatten and remove the excess oil.\nSet aside and repeat the same process with the rest of the pieces.\nStore in a tin container or enjoy.\n",

    "description": "The Icelandic Layer Cake (lagkaka) or Randalín (stripey cake) has been the most popular cake since the late 1800s. It can be either brown (with spices) or white, and depending on the cake’s color, the filling was either prune jam, rhubarb jam, or buttercream.",
    "ingredients": ["250g (1 1/8 c) soft butter", "325g (1 3/4 c) sugar", "500g (3 3/4 c) flour (add more if needed)", "2 large eggs (room temperature)"],
    "instructions": "Heat the oven to 180°c (use convection if you have it).\nWhisk together butter and sugar until light and fluffy.\nAdd 1 egg and continue whisking, then add the other egg and keep on whisking until the batter is very fluffy and light in color.\nMix flour and baking soda, and add half of the mixture and half of the milk. Start the mixer and stir until the dough starts to stick together.\nAdd the rest of the flour, milk, and vanilla essence and mix until the batter becomes smooth.\nMake sure not to mix it too well, as the cake will not rise enough and become chewy.\nPut baking paper on two baking sheets and spread the batter evenly in a rectangle. You can weigh it to ensure equal amounts on both plates.\nBake both plates for about 17-18 minutes\nRemove from the oven and let them cool completely. While it is cooling, you can make everything ready for jam-spreading.\nCut the cake in half on the short side; then there are four equally sized portions. Spread jam on one and lay another cake on top. Spread jam on top, and then add another layer of cake. You should end up with three layers of jam and four layers of cake (you can have more layers if you want).\nNow you can trim it and cut it into smaller pieces. For example, cut each quarter three times. It is possible to freeze it.",

It's no different from making instant jelly – it's just that you use fruit juice and gelatine instead of flavored jelly crystals! Make real jelly, then you can totally get away with using store-bought shortcuts for everything else – like the custard and cake.",
    "ingredients": [
      "1 x 450g / 14 oz Madeira cake or Pound cake store bought (Note 1)",
      "1/3 cup orange or other fruit-flavored liquor (like Cointreau), or apple, orange, or other fruit juice (or 2 tbsp brandy)",
      "7 tsp gelatine powder (Note 2)",
      "6 cups Cranberry juice, original (ie WITH sugar added, not No Added Sugar, Note 2)",

    ],
    "instructions": "Cut cake into 2 cm / 0.8\" cubes. Cover the bottom of a 3.5 L / 3.5 qt trifle dish with cake and sprinkle with liquor or juice. Optional extra: Scatter over 1/2 to 1 punnet halved strawberries (this is not in the ingredients list).\n\nCRANBERRY JELLY:\nHeat half of the cranberry juice in a saucepan over medium heat (3 cups / 750ml). Bring to a simmer, then turn off the stove.\nDissolve gelatine – Meanwhile, put the remaining room temperature cranberry juice into a very large bowl. Sprinkle gelatine all across the surface. Whisk until mostly dissolved.\nPour in the hot cranberry juice. Whisk until gelatin is fully dissolved.\n\nJELLY LAYER 1:\nPour HALF the warm jelly liquid carefully down the side of the trifle dish so the cake pieces are submerged. Refrigerate the trifle dish uncovered for 1.5 hours until it is partly set. It needs to be set enough so you can gently place a strawberry on it and it will stay on the surface. Proceed to Custard Layer steps.\nPour the remaining warm jelly in a bowl and leave on the counter. DO NOT refrigerate.\nMeanwhile, make the custard so it is ready to use (see below for how to make).\n\nCUSTARD LAYER:\nRemove trifle from the fridge. Whisk the room temperature custard to loosen. Spoon onto the jelly, smooth the surface, press against the wall of the glass to seal (stops jelly bleed so you get neat layers). Refrigerate uncovered for 1 hour until the surface has firmed up a bit – just enough to hold the jelly (jelly is soft, so custard doesn't need to be fully set).\n\nPARTIALLY SET REMAINING JELLY:\nGive the remaining jelly a good whisk then put it in the fridge at the same time to thicken a bit but not fully set. Refrigerate for 1 hour, but check at 30 minutes to ensure it isn't setting too fast. The jelly should be sloppy but spoonable, scoops up in a small mound. If it fully sets, you'll end up with a \"broken glass\" effect on the next jelly layer rather than a clear layer (read Note 5).\n\nJELLY LAYER 2:\nRemove trifle and jelly from the fridge. Jelly should be sloppy. Carefully spoon over jelly, smooth the surface. Scatter over 1 punnet halved strawberries (or half each raspberries and strawberries). Refrigerate for 3 hours+ (can leave in the fridge for 48 hours, until ready to assemble).\n\nASSEMBLING:\nCream: Beat cream, sugar, and vanilla until softly whipped.\nOnce the jelly is set, just before serving, top with cream, then pile over remaining berries. Dust with icing sugar.\nServe!! PS It is imperative to ensure every serving includes a bit of every layer in the trifle 😂\n\nHOMEMADE CUSTARD:\nBring milk, ¼ cup sugar, and vanilla to a simmer in a large saucepan over medium heat. Do not boil.\nIn a large bowl, whisk together remaining ¼ cup sugar and yolks, then whisk in cornflour until smooth.\nWhile whisking, carefully pour in about ½ cup of milk mixture. Once mixed in, slowly pour in remaining milk while whisking. Once incorporated and smooth, pour back into saucepan.\nReturn saucepan to stove over low heat. Whisk constantly until it becomes thick and custardy – this will happen quite quickly, about 45 seconds (ie it is liquidy when you start, then suddenly it thickens). Once thickened, remove immediately from heat (it will continue to thicken as it cools).\nImmediately pour into a bowl and cover with cling wrap, pressing onto the surface. Leave on the counter to cool to room temp until trifle is ready to layer with custard. Makes 750ml. (Note 5)",

Create a pleat down the center so that the pudding will have space to expand when cooking.\nPlace the paper and foil over the pudding basin, then tie some string under the lip of the bowl, leaving extra string to tie over the top to form a handle, tying it on the opposite end. If you don't have a steamer, like me, place a trivet in a pot and fill the water so that it's halfway up the bowl and use a tight-fitting lid.\nSteam for 6 hours, checking the water level once an hour or so, and topping it up.\nOnce you've taken the bowl out of the pot, remove the aluminum foil and waxed/parchment paper, wipe the bowl and replace with clean paper. Store in a cool place.\nTo serve: you can steam it for another two hours, OR simply microwave it for a few minutes until it's piping hot! Let stand for a few minutes before removing from the bowl. Place on a heatproof serving dish and douse with brandy. Carefully light the pudding (please do this in a safe area), then when the flame extinguishes, cut and serve with brandy sauce or butter, whipped cream, or custard.",
