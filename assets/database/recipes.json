I then use a fork so spike up little bits to give it texture!\nCarefully lift out the bowl and bake in the oven for 1 hour – turn off the heat of the oven and leave to cool completely in the oven, without opening the door. I bake my meringues late at night, and leave them to cool overnight to make things easier!\nPrepare your fruit – chop up any fruits such as the strawberries, and clean all the berries thoroughly! Whip up the double cream with the icing sugar.\nSpread/dollop/pipe the whipped up cream onto the meringue and then add the fruit on top! Add a few mint leaves for colour, and sprinkle with icing sugar! I also used a little edible glitter for a bit of Christmas cheer! Enjoy!",
